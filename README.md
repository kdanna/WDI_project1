# WDI_project1

A game of memory. The computer will generate a random pattern of flashing colors.  The player is responsible for remembering the pattern, and entering it back by clicking on each colored bar in the order it flashed.  The game gets increasingly more difficult with each round. Try to beat your previous score!

I used html, css, and javacript to create game.  Libraries used include jquery and bootstrap. This was my first project for General Assembly's web development immersive course.
